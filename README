This suite of programs allows anyone with a PDP-8/E or later to communicate with
a modern computer running Linux, Mac OS X, Windows with Cygwin, or any other
POSIX-compliant system where a standard C compiler such as gcc exists. 

                          *** TERMS OF USE ***

The software is provided "as is" without a warranty of any kind, either express
or implied.

I encourage the use of this software in any non-commercial or commercial
applications, but in fairness to other users and the developer, any changes for
improving the functionality of this program should be documented for others to
take note of. 

                          *** REQUIREMENTS ***

Hardware requirements currently are a spare M8650/M8655 asynchronous serial
interface card and the appropriate cables. The default address in the OS/8
handler is 40/41 (the default auxiliary TTY ports). This can be changed if
necessary. On the modern computer, at least one serial interface is required to
talk to the PDP-8's second serial interface.

Software requirements involve loading the system and/or non-system handlers into
OS/8 using BUILD. The modern computer needs to support the disk server, which is
easily compiled with gcc. The PDP-8 assembly files have been built with David
Gesswein's palbart assembler, as well as PAL8 under OS/8.

The disk server utilizes the standard dumprest RK05 disk image format. These
images are exactly 3,325,952 bytes long, which is 1,662,976 12-bit words packed
in 16 bits per word. The first half of the image corresponds to side 0, and the
second half, side 1. Typically, in OS/8 systems, SYS: is side 0.
